generate_file.cpp and it's a.out were made for me to train on sample data: shuffled_file and sorted_file. out.bin is the correct final result of this train

external_sort.cpp and it's external_sort.exe are the main components of the process

checker.py performs time scoring and checking for different file sizes

Makefile is activated via make, it compiles external_sort.cpp and then runs checker.py
